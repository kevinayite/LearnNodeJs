This mechanism enables the weaponized code to run a remote access tool and achieve 
persistence on the target system
 ▪ Command & Control (C2)
 • The weaponized code establishes an outbound channel to a remote server that can then be used 
to control the remote access tool and possibly download additional tools to progress the attack
 ▪ Actions on Objectives
 • The attacker typically uses the access he has achieved to covertly collect information from 
target systems and transfer it to a remote system (data exfiltration) or achieve other goals and 
motives
 • Kill chain analysis can be used to identify a defensive course-of- action matrix to counter the 
progress of an attack at each stage
