app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'static')));


you're **abstracting** the actual folder structure from the client. Let me explain it clearly:



 🛡️ Why This Is Useful:

 ✅ 1. **Security by Obscurity (basic level)**  
The client (browser) only knows that the static files are under /public, but it has **no idea** that they’re really stored in a folder called static on the server.  
> This prevents direct access to arbitrary folders on your server.



 ✅ 2. **Cleaner URLs & Flexibility**  
You can expose the files under whatever path you want.

For example:

js
app.use('/assets', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'superSecretStaticFolder')));


Now, even if the folder is called superSecretStaticFolder, clients will access it as:

http://localhost:3000/assets/filename.css


If you later change the folder name or structure, you **don’t need to update all your frontend paths**. Just update the server mapping.



 ✅ 3. **Keeps Internal Structure Private**  
You're exposing only what you want. Everything else in your project (app.js, node_modules, DB files, etc.) stays hidden.



 ✅ 4. **Optional: Full hiding**  
If you write:

js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'static')));


Then the files inside static are exposed directly with no prefix:

So if you have static/style.css, you access it at:


http://localhost:3000/style.css


But again — the client doesn’t know where on your server the file is located (static/style.css).



 🧠 TL;DR:

 The client sees only what you **choose** to expose.
 The actual serverside path is **hidden**.
 You can change file structure **without breaking** frontend URLs.
 It's a common best practice in all realworld Express apps.
